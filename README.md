The Sudoku game project is a digital version of the popular puzzle, aimed at providing an engaging and challenging experience for users. The game consists of a 9x9 grid, subdivided into nine 3x3 subgrids, where the player must fill in missing numbers from 1 to 9. The key objective is to ensure that each number appears only once per row, column, and subgrid.

The project emphasizes clean design and user-friendly interaction, featuring difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) to cater to a range of skill levels. The game engine ensures that each puzzle is solvable and offers features like real-time validation of user input, hints, and a reset option. The project also focuses on optimizing performance and ensuring a smooth, responsive interface.

Key technical highlights include:

Algorithm for puzzle generation and validation
User-friendly UI/UX design for a seamless playing experience
Ability to pause and resume the game
Options for hints and error detection
Game timer and progress tracking
Customizable Difficulty Levels: The game offers customizable difficulty levels, from beginner to expert, allowing players to select puzzles that match their skill level. Each difficulty level is generated using distinct algorithms, ensuring a balanced challenge.

Puzzle Generation Algorithm: The project employs an efficient backtracking algorithm for generating valid Sudoku puzzles. Each puzzle is guaranteed to have a unique solution, ensuring no ambiguity for the player.

Hint System: Players can request hints during gameplay, which intelligently provides guidance without giving away the solution, maintaining the puzzle's challenge.

Error Highlighting and Validation: The system can highlight errors in real-time as the player inputs numbers, helping them spot mistakes early. This feature is especially useful for beginner players.

Save and Load Feature: Players can save their progress at any point and resume later, ensuring a seamless gameplay experience. This is particularly useful for larger puzzles or when playing over extended periods.

Timer and Score Tracking: A built-in timer tracks how long the player takes to complete a puzzle. For competitive players, the game records best times for each difficulty level, encouraging improvement.

Responsive Design: The game is designed to work seamlessly across various devices, from mobile phones to tablets, ensuring a smooth and accessible user experience.

User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX): The UI is minimalistic and intuitive, making it easy for players to focus on the puzzle. The grid layout, number input methods, and interaction flows are optimized for both touch and mouse inputs.
